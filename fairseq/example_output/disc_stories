``This is my life and death, ''he said.`` You're dead.'' <P> <P> ``No, ''said I.'' <P> <P> <P> * ''No, you're not,'' he said,`` you'll be dead in a year, or maybe two. Or even a week. I 'm not really sure. You'll have to be a lot older than that. ''. <P> ``I' ve made you realize living forever sucks, I'll live my life, I've got a job, I got a wife. And I'd be happy if your dead if we had children, but my kids are n't, and I 'have n't made you.'' * <P> <P> A few seconds passed. There was silence. Then a knock at the door. * ''Call the number. Death answered.'' <P> * What do you mean? * <P> * You know there's a number? And why'd death give me to us
``The moon came up so high we looked up. It was a big, blue moon, about a full moon. There were no clouds. It was so dark. And it was the only part of the moon that we did n't see. ''. <P> <P>`` That's what my dad said. That're the first thing I 've heard since our first day. I' m pretty sure that I'd never seen it before. ``<P> <P> We were both silent, but there was a silence in the room. The moon must have been that full moon because I could see he was right. In the distance, it looked like a big red orb. But the light from it seemed like a small ball. Maybe two feet in height. Or maybe three, maybe five feet in width, its shape was n't really clear, it was nt a full circle. Just a small portion of it, and the edges of it seemed the whole thing covered everything
The pain and the light began to fade, the world's eyes slowly becoming more and more accustomed to each other. ``[UNK], [UNk], what's your name?? ''<P> <P>`` [UN k]. The light is gone, the [UNP] is gone. '' <P> My heart raced. This was not a dream. <P> ``I... where am i.... what're you looking for!'' <P>`` What, what is going on.. What's the matter? What happened? I do n't remember anything! ''<P> <P> There was a man dressed in a white lab coat in the corner of the room. A doctor. The only thing that was different about my vision was that my [UN K]. But the doctor was n't the one holding it. It was this guy. No, it was nt him. There was something else..
It seemed like she was in a dream. She was at her favorite school, and the only thing that made her feel like a normal child was being alone, and the girl was happy. But this was n't normal. No, this was different. This was nt how it felt. There was a girl. And that girl had a face. A face of fear and pain. <P> <P> Her body seemed to be the same, its features the same as hers, and it was like a small girl sitting at a lunch table in a classroom. It was like her and a man sat in the same place but he was different, and that was what was going on. The girl, her eyes were the same. Where it should have been, the man, was different but not quite the same either. How did this girl even know this man, where could he have been? How could I even know this girl? Have
``No... this ca n't be a joke. The plane must have crashed. There's no way the engines stopped. No one is on board.. ''<P> <P>`` NO! No, no no no, no!'' the passengers screamed. A loud bang shook the plane. The engines roared to a halt. Then the pilot shouted something in a foreign language. It must have been an accident. <P> <P> The plane was still in the air and they said we were about to hit the Pacific Ocean. From the cabin I could see a man shouting as he fell to the ground, screaming, and a voice saying over the radio. ``We 've lost contact with the ground! ''<P>`` What happened? Where is everyone?'' <P> ``I- I - I' m not on this plane, I'm not on anything on the plane, my name is your flight attendant. ''The voice was a man's. <P>'' Is this a joke, my plane has gone
My mouth was ajar. He looked up at me with the same expression of confusion as his face had been a few minutes ago. Looking at him, I was surprised that my eyes seemed to understand the meaning of this. <P> <P> ``He's... ''<P> <P> * My. God? * <P> <P> <P> “What? ” <P> <P> I took a breath. * My. '' <P> ” <P> <P> The silence.“ It's what you said. It sounded just like he the man. You know that she was right. That this was n't a joke? Was this a joke, or was there something else? Was there a * * something * * wrong? <P> And as the words hit my ears, I realized what this man was about to do to them. A lot more than just a joke. The words were * * a joke *, they * *
I'll tell you what I told him. You know where you were I was. The world's scientists had studied the effects of the disease. And what i said to him, it was so simple that he did n't quite understand the implications. <P> <P> The world had gone through a lot, and when you 've experienced something like this, and you're a child like me, we call the man a doctor. But it was n't just about being the doctor... Not really, but about the fact its not just a normal disease.. <P> <P> ``The repercussions are far greater than the effects. ''<P> <P> How long have it been since this. Was it a disease? It was nt like a virus or a bacteria or anything. It was a thing. A new thing, they called it. Some kind of thing I' ve never heard of before. Something new.
* ''I ca n't do it. ``* <P> <P> <P>`` [UNK]. What are you doing here?'' The doctor asked [UN K] as he looked around. <P> <P> * ''Are you alright, you're lost, are n't your eyes red? ``<P> <P> His eyes opened and his face was covered in a dark red glow. The doctor walked over to him and took out the needle from the side of his head. The pain was unbearable. *'' My god, you have no life. ''* Said the surgeon. I 'm sure it's too late I think You're dead. There is no way. How do you all know that? How is a doctor supposed to tell? My name's Jack, and I' ve never had a heart attack before and the doctors say it was a lightning strike.'' <P> <P> -... No. It's
``I 'm not, ''she said. <P> <P>`` I'll do it,'' he said, ``just get out of bed. ''<P> Her eyes opened.`` No... No. Do n't do it, man.'' <P> <P> <P> <P> * * It's over! * * <P> <P> <P> ''No,'' * he said to him. * * I' ve been the first to speak with her in a long time. I 'my wife, the first one to wake up and the one to die. You can go to hell, I' ll do this alone. Just know I 'I' M not done its.. ''. His voice was a whisper, a whisper. It was quiet, and just like the other night, his voice was just a whisper in the girl's ear. And let out a long sigh. The only sound was herself. Not the sound of the clock, but the sound.
The first war, I mean. It was a war on what would later on be called a planet, the first to come to be known as Earth, the last one. <P> <P> The day they came, the aliens called us The [UNK]. When it started the aliens arrived, it was awar that we would call it. At least, at first it seemed so. After we took them off our ships, it seemed like a simple enough thing to do. The aliens were so small, like a few hundred feet or a few miles in diameter and a few meters in diameter, our ships could n't even get past ours. Then The ships appeared, one by one... One after another. It was like a movie. Every one of them had a name, but it was n't like a name. [UN K].. The first one that attacked was the one with the first name.. <P> The one with its first name was [UN k]., the name that was
He was in my house. He watched the news. The one with the news report. ``The man with the big smile... ''<P> <P> I did n't know if myself or not. It was n't a question. <P> <P>`` Well i thought him was a fool.'' <P> ``Why not? ''<P>`` You were a fool too, man. Like your father said, when the news came through, ``He was the one who made that announcement. * The only one that could make it. A fool! *'' <P> <P> And so he stood. In the center of the room. At least his wife, her face was a little red and red. Let me get this straight. This man with your name and you're in this news report was not a fool?`` <P> ``No.. That was nt a fool
``So, I 've had several interviews for this position and the most recent one was the most important of the year, the most prestigious, the last one, and the one you'd think would get You know the gist of it all. <P> <P>`` So, being the only candidate for the vacancy, I' m sure you're going to be a bit surprised, are n't you? ''<P> ``Well, I'm not sure what i got myself into but, where does this even come from, it's a job where you 've got to be the first applicants to apply for the job, a job that does n't require any background checks, a job which does nt require a lot of background checks or any sort of background, and it'll take a lot longer than your average job to get you to go through with it, but the background checks are pretty easy.''`` So You're pretty much the only one that's got to make a good job for
``I thought you were going to. ''<P> <P>`` You did?'' the man was n't angry. <P> <P> His eyes were wide. <P> ``No, sir. But your..... ''<P> <P> The man seemed to be looking around The room, which seemed like a room of the man's own making did not seem like a room to the boy. It was more of a dark place. And the way he came in was not the same as the one before him.`` I 'm sorry for your loss, sir, I was worried about you not being the only one being here.''. * <P> <P> * you know, sir *. You're here because you need to be, and your mom is here because she is. That's all we're. I' ve got a lot more important things to do. Why do n't we go play in the
``Mr. President! ''<P> <P> It was a dark and stormy night when the President - Elect sat in the oval office. <P> The man with the white hair and the blue eyes, the one who was to be President of the United States, sat at the head of the table. <P> It had been a long, hard night, but now he had a chance for peace. And now, this man was sitting in his office, and the man had a plan. A plan that could make a man once known as the`` President. '', <P> The President - elect's voice shook the air, and the world was silent. ``Sir, I 'm sorry?'' asked his secretary,`` Sir, I'll be honest with you, sir. We do n't have time for you now. Please tell me now. ''The President, your name? <P> ``I' ve had a lot on my mind.'' <P>`` Yes Sir,
``What was your first spell? ''<P> <P> The woman sat up slowly. Her eyes darted from his to him, and he looked away, unsure of what to do. <P>`` Well, it's kind of a tricky thing to do in the dark, it'S kinda like,'' He said. The words escaped me, and the room was quiet. ``There are a few of the spells that come to mind. A lot of spells. But... This one was a little more.. ''<P>`` A little.. [UNK]..? Is that the word that the spell used in it?'' She looked down, and then up at him. No.. ``No, no it'd have to be something else. It's just.. '[UNk]' 'seemed a bit too obvious. Like a word from a book. Not the word to match. You know. Or maybe the word was a bit of
``We're going to be here, we'll be back in just a few moments. '' <P> <P> Our team stepped out into the world... and I was the only one on our team that was still in the same uniform as before that fateful day, and we'd all been given the same opportunity to do so. It would be our first time on this trip, and the first time in a long time. My team was a small, tight - knit group, and even though we were all on board the same team I knew my place would be to be the first one on the bridge. <P> <P> It's not that you'd ever know what to expect. But our time was going to have a lot more of a shock to us than we're expected, but it was one that we all prepared for, and knew the team would, as they all knew we would. There was no doubt about me, or anyone else for
``I do n't have a name. My name was never a soldier. In fact my only name is me and i am a soldier now. Where you stand, I do not have a face. ''<P> <P> The words come as a shock. <P>`` I see what you mean by it, Captain,'' the man in front of me says. ``I think you're the first to speak. I 'm the only soldier here. ''the voice is soft and calm, but there's a certain confidence to it. The other soldier is a little more confident. There's also a certain amount of confidence in the woman, though her face is a bit different. It looks like she's in a suit... and then there're two more of them. The man speaks up first. “Sir, she is a soldier?'' <P>`` Yes, I' ve been this woman's
I was the only one that knew the true meaning of my life. <P> <P> You're the only ones who know how my father, the one who made me see the end of the world. I knew what it was like to be in his shoes. To know the difference between being a soldier, and being an ordinary man who did n't serve this world. <P> <P> And you know what to tell your father, seeing that. The only thing that can make your father proud is to have your father. It makes him proud of you, and he's yours. And he'll always be mine. ``Your dad's a hero. ''<P> <P> My father, his name was my father and him myself, and the only thing keeping him in was the first person who ever spoke to me in that moment. That's why he 'm still the only father I have
``We have no choice, sir, ''I said. <P> <P>`` We have failed! You are failing!'' roared the alien for what seemed like the hundredth time. <P> <P> The commander his himself and he and his men looked at the alien in confusion. After all, this was the human that ate our ammo. ``What? '', said the commander, in a panic. “The humans eat our ammunition! ” <P> <P>“ I know it itself, ” said the commander and his aliens sounded confused. They have been eating our ammo!! <P> ’! No, it ca n't be! You think this is a joke! We need this before we all die! I 'm afraid that they had eaten all of our ammunition
``I do n't know if you're going to do this or not, but you have to do what's best for this country and everyone in it, ''Mr. Trump said. The crowd's reaction had been quiet, and everyone else in the room could n't hear what anyone in the room had just heard him say. <P> <P> When the news broke that the man with that name was about to be the President of the United States was a man who had a great name, he was very well liked by a lot of people in America who turned around to look at him when the world fell apart. After the speech a few people started to cry, and scream, but the rest of us just continued to stand on the sidelines and sit there in silence.`` He did it! We did it!'' It seemed like a relief to everyone. But the president was n't just the president, everyone he knew was a great guy, he was a friend,
