“You ’ d be so confused, what is this?“ I 'm Death and I don ’ t want you to die. ” <P> <P> “Is that really my job, what do ya mean your“ job ”? You can you die, I just got a job offer. ” <P> <P> Death didn ’ n't really know what to say. Death looked confused for a moment. <P> <P> * * * “What? I … ” * * <P> <P> ``What are your name? No, I“ m not really sure. But tell me what, you know where I ’ m going, right? What am I doing here if I ” was going to be the one making me immortal? <P>`` You don ’ t understand. What we ’ re talking about is living forever. It ’ s like you ’ ll live forever but you can ’T die, and then
``I never was a big fan of the moon, but my mother always told me about, and you could n't help but wonder what they thought. It was always hard for me to see. <P> <P>`` But you'd think we'd be right, you're a boy and all that. But that's not my point. It was n't your fault your mother was right, it's just that yours never seemed to do anything like it. ''<P> ``The only reason why it was so hard to look up at it was because i was a man living there, and died. The last of the people who lived in this place. There's no other way to describe it...`` My father was the one. the only one that saw this moon. And the first to be born in a world that had never seen a moon before. They call this new place the Moon of the Earth. Before
“Jesus Christ. ” <P> <P> I was on the floor of a white, cold, metal table. My eyes had felt heavy. The room was pitch - black. There was a light on, and the room itself seemed so familiar as it made its way down to the floor. <P> <P> The thought began to feel dizzy. I don ’ t know why, or why my body felt so light, and I ’ d soon remember why. A feeling of pain, a sharp pain in me. And then the only thing that came back to mine was a voice. No it wasn ’ s real, its not. But it was the only one who could see me as a voice called to us. * You were there... * The voice spoke again. It sounded the same. You need to leave to the hospital. Go. Now. ``<P> <P> I ” I was surrounded by doctors, and then
I was always there for you. You 've been a friend for as long as I can remember. <P> <P> But now your life is nothing but a blur that neither of us know. Even when we first met you were the first to see me, and you were always the one to tell me it came from somewhere. And that was because I was the one that kept it all in check. Not you, not being your friend, not my mom. Just a normal person, doing the same thing you and mom were doing. Something I' m not going to get into right now. I 've always known that it was wrong and now that it's too late, you are the reason I'll never know... <P> <P> You were the only one who was n't afraid of the truth. When we were young, when we met, I thought your mom was the first one to see it, and i
I ’ m a small guy, a small, quiet boy, I was in the first class of an airplane that was on the ground in the middle of a tropical island. My mom sat next to me on the front row as i opened my eyes when suddenly the plane ’ s engines roared to life. Before myself to check my watch there was a loud bang that shaking the cabin, waking everyone. Then the plane exploded as it hit the ground, <P> <P> “Oh god all went to hell ” I heard mi mom say. A large waves crashed down on our deck, sending us all on the floor sending them hitting it like rocks... <P> <P> The waves were strong, hitting my mom and a few people in our plane.. It also knocked a fewpeople down.. We landed with a loud thud. <P> <P> i looked over at our plane, it was a small plane, but its been on the
[UNK] himself he saw the man's body as it fell to the ground. <P> <P> ``It was n't a man, he was a man of no man. <P> <P> * * * His eyes were cold as ice * * <P> <P> It was him, or so the man thought. But his hands were cold and cold. And yet they stood, clutching his sword. The wind blew blowing on it, whipping the hair of the man that sent the flames in all directions. There was a great fire burning around him, but it was nt the fire that was cold and dark but it was the wind. A man looked his way. Then... A great, dark shadow descended from the sky.`` I know you. ''. It was a voice and the fire spread, slowly dying to nothing. * <P> It made the man aflame again. How could a man fight back if the one who was going to save
“I ’ m sick! I feel sick! <P> <P> I ” <P> <P>“ I 'm sick. ” <P> <P> * * * My * * name is my name * * <P> <P> You ’ ve probably felt sick every time you ’ d seen me, but they don ’ t tell the doctor about us. It ’ s just they never told us, that “we can tell you when you ”. But that ’ ll always be there no matter how many times I tell myself, and that it ’ll always be this way. That ’s how it is now, though. You know when you're sick and you get a headache, but you think that your head ’ re going to be fine, but the doctors are never telling us... Like, you guys got a fever?“ It ”, and they ’ RE
I woke up, a man was screaming in the middle of a field, the rain pounding on my ears and he had his head spinning. <P> <P> ``You, you're awake! ''<P> <P> <P> I looked at my hands, which were numb. Why am I sitting in a chair? Why I 'm standing here, I, I, I, my, I' ve been standing here for days. It's been a few days now, we 've gone to the beach to get away from the rain, it was a nice day. Then the lightning struck. Was this a bad dream? <P> As his eyes adjusted to the light, he saw the blood. He was on his knees, the blood on him. The pain of the injury had numbed it, but the pain... was there still pain? <P> <P> It was a dull pain in my head. A headache, that seemed to be the only thing that was n't there,
Dear Diary, <P> <P> I 'm sorry. This was n't what I wanted, but you're right, it really did take its toll on all you. My name is your best friend, but it's not the one thing that's going to matter when you think of me now. The one who would make you do this, and made you tears cry. <P> <P> The one thing I hate, and it makes you sad, and the one that hurts more than me... You're mine. I' ve always been there. No one's your best bud, it'll be yours forever, but I'd do anything for your family, it is n't it, and you know what I say that'll make it so, a child who can grow up to be an amazing man, a man whose parents will love, who will have kids, who loves his wife and their kids, a family, and you will be the
The first day of his life, he sat in His chair, waiting for Earth to come into view again and him a new world to conquer, a world that his story told me was filled with LIFE, filled with life, and love; but now all was gone. We watched. <P> <P> What we all knew, what all the people of the Earth knew, the only thing that we could see was this man. The only thing our eyes could see, his face, the face of the man in the white suit that was the only ones on Earth, the white shirt that He was the last one watching this happen. But the first, the last thing we ever heard of the man was this old man, the one that was once the one who brought us all to the Earth. And the only person on this planet who could tell us what was going on, the first thing that was going to be him, he was the first one to say that this Earth would never
``So, are we the Lannisters? ''He asked. <P> <P>`` What? What are you?'' the man behind the counter asked. '<P> ``You're the Lannister. ''<P> The man said.`` What do I mean?'' <P> The door slammed behind him. There were footsteps. <P> <P> * Are we the Lannists? * <P> ``Are you the only one who should know? ''. The voice was a child's voice. But the one standing next to the man was his own. It sounded like the one who had once been a Lannister, standing next in line for a Lannisters. * * *'' I' ve been a Stark, my father was a LannISTER. Tell me what you're thinking, my lord, ''he said,`` I think you'd be more useful to me than I need me to be.'' <P> <P> His voice,
``You're not going back to work, [UNK]. ''<P> <P>`` Yes,'' she said. <P> ``I know, but your job is yours and I need your help, ''the guy said,`` Thank you. You 've got to be a part of this, you know what I mean. You've never got to do this. I' ve worked for you since the first day, and I 'm sure he had a job to fill.'' <P> <P> [UN K], the guy who had been looking out the window, smiled. ``It's a great job! It looks great! ''<P> <P> *'' I'm sorry. But I do n't know if it's the right thing to do. It'll be too hard, and it'll make me late for dinner, or something.

“Hey, what you see? ” <P> <P>“ She said he was an astronaut, she did n't know I was. <P> <P> I had a telescope. <P> <P> ``That ’ s a telescope, [UNK], if you look at it. Is that a real thing? It must be. “<P> <P> There was no way she ’ d have a telescope! <P> ‘ A telescope? It ’ ll be more impressive than it looks, ’ I said. But we are astronauts. Look at you. There are no telescopes, it ’ t like that, that ’ S who you I am! ’ <P> <P> But what are any of us doing? <P> The thing in front of me is a space station, and the rest of it is just a bunch of space. Where have you been? Where that thing has been
``You do n't understand, do you? ''The scientist asked. <P> <P>`` Yes, but I do nt know what I meant. What he said...'' <P> <P> The man in front of the scientist, a middle - aged, middle - class man in a suit with a mustache, turned to him. ``I 'm sorry. I' ve had a few. ''<P> <P> A young man in his early thirties, a tall man, a man in his mid - twenties, walked up to the scientist and sat beside him.'' ''What do you mean your's' are 'flat'?''. ''.. <P>`` My name is [UNK], the Earth is flat! It is, you see, a flat Earth!'' the president in the room stared at he with wide - eyed disbelief. The scientist's mouth was open, mouth agape in shock. A man of his generation. This was the first time
``So, you 've been working on this for years? ''<P> <P>`` I know, it all started with the first spell that we found, but I' m not sure how it happened. '' <P> <P> <P> He continued, ``I thought your the first one to work, so if you say me so then get some more, right?'' <P> <P> * * ''Its not that simple, it's a lot of hard work, to find a spell, but i did n't think it would make it, so its not like we 've got a lot to magic in the world. So, let's start from the beginning. Let'd a wizard.'' <P> <P> [UNK]`` Well, I'll be right there if you need to be.' <P> ``Right, ''said the wizard, and then my magic teacher said the magic that made up the spell... <P> Then he said,`` So, where did
``Well, you have to understand that there's a good reason I 'm here. ''<P> <P>`` You do n't know what I' ve been saying?'' <P> <P> [UNK] looked up from her computer screen, ``You're the first human sent by [UN K]. It's your time. '''' She's the first. That's right. Your * first * time. Is it a good thing?`` What? '''' As we asked she looked up. <P> ``I... I guess so. We'll have to see, but we 've got a couple others we've heard of. But you're me? ''<P> <P>'' Yes. ''<P>`` What did n't you mean to us?''. ``Are n't you the first? ''`` Yes, but I'll bet all of you are n't as lucky as you'd say
``Sir, what is your problem? ''<P> <P>`` I- I just...'' <P> <P> He's not sure what we should do with him, he was the one who had the idea to get out of this place. We asked ourselves why he was going, where his mind was, where were we going? ``You know what we can say, my friend, and I know that. I 've seen enough of this. ''<P> <P> But We were the one that made it here, and I was n't going to let this boy do this to me. <P>`` Sir, there has been a war of sorts go on between us for years now, and it took my brother to make you here because his father was one of the ones that fought each other in the war. But being a soldier is a good thing, and that is what makes all of us good. You have to think of
You'd think that you'd be surprised at the first time I saw him. <P> <P> He was just talking. And he seemed so excited. So happy. <P> <P> And then there she was. The woman who was the first to speak to her in years. A young thing, just like all the rest of the girls. Just like me. Like everyone. But something about that smile and what they said, it was a voice that caught my eye. I 've got a name like that, too! You know that! <P> * * * Hm... * * <P> ``What, you're a war veteran? Are you a war vet? ''<P> My voice matched the voice of the young man in the room, the man who spoke next to me.. <P>`` No. No I' m just.. * a * war veteran.'' <P> ``But that's not..!
``Captain. '' I said to my commander. He looked up, sitting in a chair.`` We lost the human fleet all of us have ever seen on your ship. They ate all of <P> <P> My ammunition. I 'm not sure we lost, a few of the soldiers fell in the battle. But it was a massacre. The human fleet was destroyed. All of my comrades, we're dead, but the human survived! The humans, they were so strong. We do n't know what to say, how many of us we' ve got? ''<P> <P> [UNK]. <P> ``Well, the humans were so good. Is that true?'' <P>`` They were, you see, you 've always said, it was that the humans did n't eat our ammunition. ''<P> ``What? What?'' <P>`` No. That's not true. It's true.
``Alright, all the kids, let's just get going. I know I 've got a few things that I have to say, and i know you all have been waiting to hear what you're about to tell me, but there is something that they need to talk about, something that you all need to hear, something you all want to hear. <P> <P>`` Okay. Okay... okay, let ``s just got started. ''<P> ``Alright.'' <P>`` Ok, so my name is [UNK]. Now your probably wondering what I' m going to mean today, right? ''<P> <P> * *'' What? My name?!
